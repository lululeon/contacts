# Contacts

Fullstack microservices app with Java, Spring Boot, Angular.
This is more of a backup repo than a deployable repo (each microservice is a subfolder for now).

The 'Contacts' app is a test build (i.e. recap / practical application of trying to teach myself java).

## Components
The modules are:
- Eureka [Discovery Server](./contacts-ds)
- [Backend](./contacts-be) database + a basic CRUD REST API
  - uses sqlite3 for demo purposes
- Frontend API
- Gateway Service
